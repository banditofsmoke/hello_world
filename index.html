From a cybersecurity perspective, it's a complex puzzle. But from an educator's standpoint, it presents an even more interesting challenge: how do we maintain reliable ways to distinguish authentic content from synthetic content in an environment where that distinction is becoming increasingly difficult?</p>

                <p data-translate="problem-1-desc">AI systems are being deployed with broad operational permissions across infrastructure through protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). While this enables powerful capabilities, it creates interesting research opportunities around prompt injection, social engineering, and adversarial input patterns. Every MCP connection creates trust relationships that expand potential attack surfaces.</p>

                <p data-translate="problem-2-desc">Tools like Veo3 can now generate convincing multimedia content from simple text prompts‚Äîno source material required. This includes historically accurate recreations and contextually appropriate educational materials that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic content.</p>

                <p data-translate="scenario-detail">Imagine a malicious actor crafts a sophisticated prompt injection against a news organization's AI agent system. The agent, connected via MCP to content management and social media APIs, receives what appears to be a routine request to generate "historical educational content" about current events.</p>
                <p data-translate="scenario-impact">Within hours, social media could be flooded with content showing Winston Churchill discussing current NATO strategy, or Roosevelt addressing contemporary economic policy. The content engages viewers (history feels like social media), it's technically accurate about historical figures' mannerisms, and it addresses current events people care about.</p>
                <p data-translate="scenario-question">How do we help people distinguish between legitimate historical analysis and AI-generated anachronistic content? This is the kind of verification challenge that could really benefit from open source solutions.</p>
